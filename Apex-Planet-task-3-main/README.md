Task 3: Interactive Web Interface with API Integration

This repository contains the source code for my third internship task at ApexPlanet Software Pvt. Ltd. The project is a responsive web interface featuring an image carousel, a dynamic quiz, and seamless API integration to fetch real-time data.

**Key Features:**

1.  **Image Carousel:**
    * Fully responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.
    * Interactive controls for navigation.

2.  **Dynamic Quiz Section:**
    * Engaging user interface for a quiz experience.
    * Dynamically loads questions and tracks user answers.

3.  **API Integration:**
    * Fetches real-time data from a public API.
    * Displays the fetched data on the web page.

This task allowed me to deepen my understanding of front-end development, focusing on dynamic content, user interaction, and data fetching. It was a valuable exercise in building a feature-rich, single-page application.

**Technologies Used:**
* HTML5
* CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* Fetch API
