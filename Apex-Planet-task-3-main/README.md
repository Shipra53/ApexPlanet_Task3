# Task 3: Interactive Web Interface with API Integration

This repository showcases the source code for my third internship assignment at ApexPlanet Software Pvt. Ltd. The project involves building a responsive and interactive single-page web application featuring an image carousel, a dynamic quiz component, and live data integration using APIs.

# Main Features:
** Responsive Image Carousel ** 

Adapts smoothly across various screen sizes.

Includes intuitive navigation controls for a seamless experience.

Interactive Quiz Module

Provides an engaging quiz interface for users.

Loads randomized questions and monitors responses in real-time.

Live API Data Integration

Utilizes a public API to fetch real-time information.
